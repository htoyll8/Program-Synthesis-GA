# Grammar-Based Genetic Programming (GBGP)

Grammar-Based Genetic Programming (GBGP) is an approach that incorporates a formal grammar into the genetic programming process, ensuring that evolved programs adhere to specific syntactic and semantic rules.

## What is Grammar-Based Genetic Programming?

1. **Incorporates Grammar:** GBGP uses a formal grammar, often expressed in Backus-Naur Form (BNF), to define the structure of possible programs.
2. **Constrained Search Space:** Restricts the search space to valid programs, reducing the likelihood of generating nonsensical or invalid code.
3. **Ensures Semantics:** Embeds domain knowledge to ensure meaningful semantics.
4. **Facilitates Reusability:** Enhances reusability and allows for consistent and interpretable results.

## How Does It Work?

- **Initialization:** Generates the initial population according to the specified grammar.
- **Crossover & Mutation:** Applies genetic operators that preserve grammatical structure.
- **Evaluation:** Performs fitness evaluation based on the problem's objectives.
- **Selection & Evolution:** Proceeds with parent selection and evolution, ensuring adherence to the grammar.

## Examples and Applications

- **Symbolic Regression:** Discovers mathematical expressions that fit data within specific constraints.
- **Automatic Code Generation:** Generates code that meets specific standards or follows particular patterns.
- **Optimizing Complex Systems:** Optimizes parameters in complex systems like networks within certain rules and constraints.

## Future Work

As explored in this project, I've applied statistical language modeling to genetic programming by inducing a language model of the Python programming language from a multi-megatoken corpus of Python source code. The language model is then used to inform the search and selection processes of a genetic programming system, specifically targeting the task of automated program repair. By assigning probabilities to sequences of tokens that are more likely to be valid Python code, the language model helps constrain and direct the search process. I observed that this approach results in higher-fitness individuals compared to a baseline approach that doesn't utilize the language model.

While the project doesn't provide specific suggestions for future extensions, it does highlight the novelty and promise of applying statistical language modeling to formal languages like programming languages. The success I achieved in using a language model of Python to enhance automated program repair in genetic programming implies that similar strategies could be applied to other tasks within genetic programming or even other areas of computer science where formal languages play a role. Future research could delve into the use of more sophisticated language models or expand this approach to other programming languages beyond Python.

## Conclusion

Grammar-Based Genetic Programming combines the flexibility of genetic programming with the rigor of formal grammars. By defining the space of valid programs, GBGP enhances the efficiency of the search process, ensures coherent solutions, and provides a structured approach to program synthesis. It's an exciting extension of traditional genetic programming with applications in various domains.
